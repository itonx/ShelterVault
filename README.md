# ShelterVault
ShelterVault helps you to save your passwords in your local machine. All passwords are encrypted with the master key you set up at startup.

# Create a master key
- A database with all your passwords will be saved at user's profile directory.
- All passwords are encrypted using AES and a random initial vector.
