# Privacy Policy for ShelterVault

## Last Updated: 03/01/2025

1. Introduction

Welcome to ShelterVault, a password manager designed to provide secure storage for your credentials. Your privacy is our top priority, and this Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect your information.

2. Data Collection and Storage

ShelterVault is designed to prioritize your privacy and security. We do not collect or store any of your sensitive data, such as passwords, on our servers. All passwords and stored information are encrypted using AES-256 encryption and remain on your device unless explicitly backed up by you.

3. Encryption and Security

ShelterVault employs AES-256 encryption, a military-grade encryption standard, to protect your data. Your master password is never stored or transmitted; it is used to derive an encryption key locally on your device. Without this key, your data cannot be accessed.

4. No Tracking or Analytics

We do not collect or use any tracking mechanisms, analytics, or telemetry to monitor user activity. Your interactions with ShelterVault remain private and local to your device.

5. Cloud synchronization

ShelterVault is able to load and synchronize your encrypted data by using your own Azure CosmosDB resources. You're responsible for setting up CosmosDB throughput and limit your Azure resources according to your needs.

6. Third-Party Services

ShelterVault does not share your data with third parties. If the software offers optional cloud backup integrations, you will have full control over enabling or disabling such features.

7. User Responsibility

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your master password and any backups you create. Since we do not store your credentials, we cannot recover lost or forgotten passwords.

8. Compliance with Local Laws

ShelterVault is developed in Mexico and adheres to applicable privacy laws. Users outside Mexico should ensure compliance with their local regulations.

9. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
